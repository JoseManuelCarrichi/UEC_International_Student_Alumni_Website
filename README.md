# Group 3 UEC International Student Alumni Website

Please check the backlog below to see the current status of the project. Once you've added a new feature, be sure to commit your changes and make a merge request to the main branch.

## ToDo
- [ ] Add news. Currently, news is random.
- [ ] Dynamically redirect to the page that displays the appropriate content for each news item.
- [ ] Add a view of the university's location on Google Maps to the contact page.
- [ ] Review and correct the content of the 'about' page.
- [ ] Add team information to the 'about' page. I think this could be the program managers, or if you think it's more appropriate, we could add information about the team members.

## Done
